            <h2 id="1" class="section-heading">Overview</h2>

            <p>Investing is taking saving to the next level. Saving is a core element of financial wellness. Many bank accounts give account owners a very small percentage of interest on the money in their checking or savings account. However, there are more effective ways to leverage savings. A diversified portfolio of investments can help generate larger returns than a bank account, essentially using money to make more money.</p>

            <h2 id="2" class="section-heading">Inflation</h2>

<p>Inflation is the rate at which the money loses its purchasing power. This means that the value of a dollar today will not be the same in 10 years. Weird - a dollar is always going to be worth 100 cents, right? Well, yes, but the amount of goods/services you get in return is what changes. Notice how the price of things always seem to creep up over the years? That’s a result of inflation. You can view the annual rate of inflation for the United States online, as there are a variety of sources that monitor those numbers. Investing can help counter inflation.</p>

            <h2 id="3" class="section-heading">Types of Investments</h2>

<p>There are a huge assortment of investments available in today’s world. With that said, some purchases are better than others. You want to try and purchase appreciating assets - aka items that will have their value grow and increase over time. Technically, anything can be an investment. A Beanie Baby that you purchased for $20 could skyrocket to $5,000 because of its rarity.</p>

<p>However, certain items usually decrease in value over time - and they make for poor investments. A good example is buying a luxury vehicle, as its value often falls substantially after the first year or so of ownership. With that said, this is not a blanket statement. Perhaps a car’s manufacture goes out of business, thus making the car you own more valuable.</p>

<p>Provided is a list of common investments; it’s valuable to recognize the sheer quantity of and diversity of types. However, for now, we will only discuss a few of them in more detail.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Savings Accounts</li>
	<li>Money Market Accounts</li>
	<li>Certificates of Deposits (CDs)</li>
	<li>Bonds</li>
	<li>Stocks</li>
	<li>Funds</li>
	<li>Options</li>
	<li>Futures</li>
	<li>Annuities</li>
	<li>Precious Metals</li>
	<li>Real Estate</li>
	<li>Cryptocurrency</li>
</ul>

            <h2 id="4" class="section-heading">Risk</h2>

<p>All types of investments carry some degree of risk. The amount of risk varies on the type of investment. For government backed bonds, the risk that the purchaser takes on is the loss of value of the bond if the United States government collapses. Evidently, this is a very small amount of risk. Therefore, the amount of benefit the investor gets is also marginal.</p>

<p>In general, the more risk an investor takes on - the greater the potential reward. A very early investor in Uber could have pledged $5,000 to the company for a significant stake in their company, thereby returning hundreds of thousands of dollars when the company goes public, depending on the deal specifics. However, that same investor could have also pledged money to a collection of other startups. In these other situations, they could have all gone out of business, thus giving him absolutely no return on his investment.</p>

<p>An individual must determine the amount of risk that they are comfortable with. Then, they should purchase assets that match that same level. Unfortunately, there is no standardization of risk classification. Risk also varies not just by investment type, but also by the individual investment itself. A government bond is statistically less risky than a corporate bond, as a corporate bond is backed by a company, rather than the Federal government.</p>

            <h2 id="5" class="section-heading">Diversification</h2>

<p>As there is often no guarantee that an asset will increase in value, what do investors do the manage their amount of risk? The key here is to find a balance in diversification. If you have all your long term savings in one stock - and it goes up - great! However, what if it goes down - or even crashes? Yikes, now your entire portfolio is gone. A diversified portfolio helps manage risk by ensuring that one’s investments are across a variety of types and sectors. Therefore, if the biotech stock you purchased goes down, your entire portfolio isn’t in the dirt. A good portfolio is balanced across a variety of investment types, each varying in risk.</p>
