            <h2 id="1" class="section-heading">Money = Happiness?</h2>

            <p>Does money equate into happiness? If you’re in a cash strapped situation, I’m sure the answer is a clear “yes.” The same goes for the other extreme. If you were Bill Gates, with his nearly unlimited resources, I’m sure you would be happier too. However, the more feasible response to this question is that there’s a balance. Money is a tool, a method for obtaining goods and services. The key here is to try and focus your spending on the things that make you truly happy.</p>

<p>Upgrading everything, for the sake of it, is not the way. Allocating a responsible amount of money into a hobby, sport, or activity that brings you joy and happiness is a mature and entirely fine decision. Financial security does not always mean that you have to live in a shack, or eat ramen for every mean. Sure, at the start, this may be the case, especially if struggling with high amounts of debt. However, for the majority of people, it simply means being smart and choosing where your money goes.</p>

            <h2 id="2" class="section-heading">Extra Expenses</h2>

<p>The savings section of this site goes over the whole concept of budgeting. In short, a budget allows you to list and tally up all of your incomes and expenses in detail. Extra expenses, as defined here, as smaller, commonly occurring, costs. Commonly used examples are expensive lattes, lunches, etc. However, they may not always be so obvious; perhaps you’re enrolled in your wireless carrier’s 6 month upgrade program. Or, you pay an extra monthly fee for the 4k HD version of Netflix.</p>

<p>Building on the previous conversation about money and happiness, some of these “extra expenses” are alright to have! The key is choosing which extras actually bring true value or happiness. The more small monthly expenses you can eliminate, the more money that is back in your pocket. While eliminating maybe $25 dollars a month in extra fees is not going to pay for a graduate degree, the small steps and behavior changes are what eventually lead to financial wellness.</p>


            <h2 id="3" class="section-heading">The Value of a Dollar</h2>

<p>Establishing the true value and/or cost of an item or service is difficult. A trick I like to use is converting the cost of something into time, via your hourly wage. Let’s say you make $15 an hour (approximately $30,000 a year) and you are debating purchasing a Childish Gambino hoodie for $60. Is that hoodie worth 4 hours of working? If the answer is yes, then great - enjoy! Regardless, this trick helps visualize the amount of effort you need to have certain goods or services.</p>

            <h2 id="4" class="section-heading">Sales & Discounts</h2>

<p>This may seem obvious - but making purchases at a discount can help reduce expenses. Be wary of the distinction of buying something just because it is on sale - and rather, trying to buy the things you need when they’re on sale.</p>

            <h2 id="5" class="section-heading">Price Matching</h2>

<p>Price matching is getting one retailer or supplier to match the price of another for the same good or material. This is often easier than you think - a quick question at the cashier or customer service section of many stores will often price match the same item found online, as long as it is a major retailer like Walmart, Amazon, etc. The rules vary by store. Regardless, it never hurts to quickly Google the bigger ticket items you’re purchasing when you’re waiting in line to checkout.</p>
