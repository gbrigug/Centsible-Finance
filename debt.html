            <h2 id="1" class="section-heading">Overview</h2>

            <p>In the financial sense, debt can be defined as when a person owes money to another person, group, or entity. The person who owes money is called the borrower, with the person who loaned the money being referred to as the lender. A gift does not classify as debt, as it does not need to be repaid.</p>

            <p>There are many types of debts: credit card debt, student loans, personal loans, medical debt, auto loans, payday loans, etc. The common factor with all of these is that someone borrowed money to purchase something else.</p>


            <h2 id="2" class="section-heading">The Basics</h2>

<p>As previously stated, there are many types of debts. For example, Bob needs $20,000 to start a bakery. Unfortunately, Bob does not have that amount of capital, so he needs to seek financing. A lender, oftentimes a bank, loans money to people like Bob. However, the bank wants to profit off of their loan, so they charge fees and interest. Bob agrees to take out a business loan for $20k, but it will cost him a total $23k to repay the loan over 3 years. Ultimately, Bob pays $3,000 for the privilege of getting $20k up front - and the bank makes $3k of profit over the 3 year agreement.</p>

            <h2 id="3" class="section-heading">Principal & Interest</h2>

<p>We need to quickly define a few terms. In the above situation, Bob's loan had a $20k principal, which was the original amount the requested from the bank. The $3k can be referred to as interest.</p>

<p>Interest is often determined as a percentage of the principal amount. With that said, there may be some base fees that the lender charges to take out the loan, regardless of the amount or repayment length. Interest rates can be fixed or variable; fixed is self explanatory - you may have a loan with a 5% interest rate. Conversely, a variable rate loan may change over time, depending the general market for interest rates for loans of similar type.</p>

            <h2 id="4" class="section-heading">Repayment Strategies</h2>

<p>There's two main strategies when it comes to debt. While one is better from a mathematical perspective, the other provides some legitimate psychological and motivational benefits.</p>

<p>The first method is called the avalanche method. The goal is for the borrower to pay off the item with the highest interest rate first. Often times, this is some sort of credit card debt. Once they've paid it off, they would devote their extra capital to the item with the next highest rate, etc.</p>

<p>The snowball method is yet another effective strategy. It focuses on motivating the debtor by killing off the smallest debts first. While it is not mathematically the best choice, it feels good to see one's number of financial obligations dwindle.</p>

            <h2 id="5" class="section-heading">Refinancing</h2>

<p>With a solid credit score, this is an excellent option to explore. For example, Aaron has student loans; he's paid them on time for 3 years now, but he still has more payments to make. As Aaron has been diligent about paying his loans, and the rest of his bills, he has a good credit score. With a little shopping around, he can refinance his original loan to a new bank or credit union, thus giving him a lower interest rate. This move is beneficial for both parties: Aaron gets a lower interest rate, thus saving him money over the long term- and the new bank gets to make some profit off of him, as opposed to not having him as a customer at all.</p>

            <h2 id="6" class="section-heading">Bankruptcy</h2>

<p>Bankruptcy comes in many forms, with the two most commonly discussed options being Chapter 7 & 13:</p>

<p>With Chapter 7, a debtor is relieved of all their debts and they have a clean slate. This comes at a cost, as their assets are liquidated, and the bankruptcy is noted on their credit report for 7-10 years. A person does not lose everything when declaring Chapter 7, as key assets like a house and a car are often retained. The goal is to get another chance at financial wellness - not to make the person homeless.</p>

<p>A Chapter 13 bankruptcy is similar, but one's assets are not liquidated. Instead, a debtor agrees to pay X amount over a 3 or 5 year plan. At the end of that plan, the rest of their debts are resolved. This helps a person recover from making a few bad financial choices in life.</p>

<p>These options should generally not be one's first choice, although they do allow for a way out. The rules for each type vary based on location and the laws in that area. A lawyer is best equipped to work through the specifics of each. If one cannot afford to set aside money for a lawyer, free or low cost legal aid clinics are a good places to try.</p>


            <h2 id="7" class="section-heading">Is Debt Bad?</h2>

<p>Ah, good question! I don't believe debt is inherently bad. Loans and debt allow for people to get many benefits in life. Without mortgages, very few people would be homeowners. Similarly, financing enables people to get what they want sooner. However, debt can become bad if it is not managed correctly.</p>

<p>One must look at the return on investment for taking out debt. If you're pursuing a large auto loan to get a luxury sportscar, it may not be a great financial choice to spend a lot of money for a depreciating asset. Conversely, if a working adult takes out a moderate sized loan to pay for graduate school, with the understanding that he/she will get a pay raise at work, that would probably be a good use of debt. The rules are not always black and white - one must do careful research and planning when pursuing financing for their purchases in life.</p>
